# Reference

A minimal Lox project is composed of a single Go package containing one or more
`.lox` files defining at least one `@lexer` section and one `@parser` section.

* [Lexer reference](./lexer_reference)
* [Parser reference](./parser_reference)

The package must also contain at least one `.go` file that defines the parser
type and production actions, among other things.

* [Go reference](./go_reference)
